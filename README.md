# Theory of Mind + Abduction

This package provides a [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net)
agent that combines Theory of Mind and abductive reasoning to interpret and
extract information from the actions of other agents.

Check the [documentation](https://nmontesg.github.io/tomabd/html/index.html)
for a detailed description of the agent model.
